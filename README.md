# Principles of Programming Languages Parser Project

# Project Description
* This project was to write a grammer for a basic version of Python. The grammer was created with ANTLR
* The grammer supported the following:
*   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %,)
*   - Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)

* How to use/run
* 1. Pull the latest version the of the project for this Github repositiory
* 2. Run the command antlr4-parse python.g4 start project_deliverable_3.py
*       - gui can be used to see graphical representations of each code segment

* Video Link
* The video link is available on the canvas site.
